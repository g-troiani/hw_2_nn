## üìã Project Setup Prompts

### Initial Application Setup
```
Create a React application for visualizing neural networks with forward propagation. 
The app should demonstrate how a neural network processes environmental data to make 
biodiversity impact predictions. Set up a three-panel layout with:
1) Data Input Panel for environmental parameters
2) Neural Network Visualization in the center  
3) Results and Analysis Panel

Use modern CSS with gradients, animations, and responsive design. The color scheme 
should reflect environmental themes with blues and greens.
```

### Component Architecture
```
Structure the application with these main components:
- App.js: Main application logic with state management for neural network
- NeuralNetworkVisualization: SVG-based network diagram with animations
- DataInputPanel: Interactive controls for environmental inputs
- PropagationSteps: Step-by-step calculation breakdown
- ResultsPanel: Prediction results and environmental analysis

Each component should be modular, reusable, and have its own CSS file.
```

## üß† Neural Network Implementation Prompts

### Forward Propagation Logic
```
Implement forward propagation for a 3-4-1 neural network that:
- Takes 3 environmental inputs: temperature change, precipitation change, CO2 levels
- Processes through 4 hidden neurons with ReLU activation
- Outputs a single biodiversity impact score using sigmoid activation
- Uses predefined weights that model climate-biodiversity relationships
- Shows step-by-step calculations with mathematical formulas

Include input normalization to scale values appropriately for the network.
```

### Network Architecture Definition
```
Create a neural network with this specific architecture:
Input layer: 3 neurons (Temperature ¬∞C, Precipitation %, CO2 ppm)
Hidden layer: 4 neurons with ReLU activation function
Output layer: 1 neuron with sigmoid activation

Use these predefined weights for climate modeling:
Input to Hidden: [[0.1, 0.2, -0.1, 0.15], [-0.15, 0.25, 0.1, -0.2], [0.05, -0.1, -0.15, 0.3]]
Hidden to Output: [[0.4], [0.3], [-0.5], [0.2]]

Make the calculations transparent and educational.
```

## üé® Visualization Component Prompts

### SVG Network Diagram
```
Create an interactive SVG visualization of the neural network that shows:
- Circular nodes for each neuron with labels
- Lines connecting neurons representing weights
- Dynamic coloring based on activation values (green for positive, red for negative)
- Connection thickness proportional to weight magnitude
- Hover effects to show weight values
- Animation effects during forward propagation

Position the layers horizontally with proper spacing and make it responsive.
```

### Animation and Interactivity
```
Add smooth animations to the neural network visualization:
- Pulse effect on neurons during propagation
- Connection lines that glow and change opacity based on signal strength
- Progressive animation showing data flow from input to output
- Color transitions that represent activation intensity
- Loading indicators during calculations

Use CSS keyframes and transitions for smooth 60fps animations.
```

## üìä Data Input Interface Prompts

### Environmental Parameter Controls
```
Create an intuitive input panel with:
- Range sliders for temperature change (-2¬∞C to +4¬∞C)
- Precipitation change slider (-30% to +30%)  
- CO2 concentration slider (400ppm to 800ppm)
- Each slider should have gradient colors representing the parameter
- Real-time value display with proper units
- Input validation and constraints

Add preset scenario buttons for common climate scenarios.
```

### Preset Scenarios Implementation
```
Implement preset climate scenarios with these configurations:
1. Current Trend: +1.5¬∞C, -5% precipitation, 420ppm CO2
2. Mitigation: +1.0¬∞C, 0% precipitation, 450ppm CO2
3. Worst Case: +3.5¬∞C, -20% precipitation, 700ppm CO2  
4. Optimistic: +0.5¬∞C, +5% precipitation, 380ppm CO2

Each button should instantly load the scenario values and update the interface.

Display mathematical formulas alongside the numerical calculations.
```

### Mathematical Explanations
```
Add educational content explaining the mathematical operations:
- Weighted sum formula: z = Œ£(w·µ¢ √ó x·µ¢) + b
- ReLU activation: f(z) = max(0, z)
